## Technical Discussions & Solutions for ElizaOS

### Key Technical Fixes
- **Rollback to older versions**: Use `git checkout <commit-hash>`.  
- **Bun migration**: Use `bun run build` and `bun install` instead of `pnpm`.  
- **Dynamic knowledge ingestion**: Workarounds include restarting the agent, deleting `db.sqlite`, or using `folder2knowledge`.  
- **Autoclient scheduling**: Requires cron config in `character.json`.  
- **Extending `TemplateType` for plugins**: Modify `types.d.ts` and export the type extension.  
- **Free API access**: OpenAI requires payment, alternatives include **Ollama (local)** and **Together.ai (free credits)**.  
- **Ollama setup issues**: Ensure service is running (`ollama serve`), check port conflicts (`sudo lsof -i :11434`), pull models (`ollama pull hermes3:70b`).  
- **PDF knowledge ingestion**: Use `folder2knowledge` to convert PDFs into JSON.  
- **24/7 agent deployment**: Options include **cloud VPS (Linode, DigitalOcean), Oracle Cloud free tier, or `pm2`**.  
- **Twitter client issues**: Ensure proper `.env` setup, plugin registration, and manual cookie authentication if needed.  
- **Discord client issues**: Check `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`, permissions, and intents.  
- **MongoDB sharding error**: Free-tier **Atlas does not support sharding**, requires **M10+ paid tier**.  
- **Plugin development**: Example provided for a **text-generation plugin** using character context.  
- **Database cache issues**: Clear `.elizaos/cache`, set `CACHE_TTL=0`, flush Redis (`redis-cli flushall`).  
- **Twitter API rate limits**: Use **exponential backoff, account rotation, fresh cookies**.  

### Repository Management & System Prompt Generation
- **Repo management**: [nullfoxgiven] suggested adopting **Git Flow** for better organization.
